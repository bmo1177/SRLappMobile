2. Purpose / Problem Statement
Traditional language learning methods are often inefficient, time-consuming, and lack personalization. Students struggle with retention and motivation.

Goal: Transform 60 hours of classroom learning into 15 minutes of daily practice.
Key Motivations: * Optimization of learning time. * Acquisition of AI capabilities for personalized education. * Addressing the "forgetting curve" with scientific methods.
3. Methods & Materials
We utilized a modern, scalable technology stack to build a robust mobile learning experience.

Technology Stack
Infrastructure: Google Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions).
AI & Intelligence: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for generating mnemonics, conversational practice, and feedback.
Mobile Development: Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for a reactive, modern UI.
Key Algorithms
Spaced Repetition (SM-2): Optimizes review intervals to boost retention by up to 200%.
Multi-Armed Bandit: Smart notification engine that learns the best time to nudge users for practice.
4. Results & Solution
The platform delivers a comprehensive learning ecosystem:

Efficiency: Bite-sized sub-200ms interactions.
Personalization: AI-driven adaptive difficulty and mnemonics.
Engagement: Gamification elements (Streaks, Badges, Leagues).
Accessibility: Offline access and "Simplified Mode" for universal design.
